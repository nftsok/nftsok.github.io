The core of the issue lies in the method of calculating the index: index = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, msg.sender, block.difficulty, block.timestamp))) % totalSize;. This approach, which utilizes the nonce, message sender, block difficulty, and block timestamp to compute a hash value, followed by a modulus operation with the total size, is criticized for its inadequacy in ensuring true randomness. This vulnerability in the randomization process could potentially be exploited, leading to predictable and manipulable NFT ID generation, which is a significant concern in the context of blockchain security and integrity."

After analysis, it was found that this was related to a loophole in the airdrop mechanism of APE Coin. Specifically, whether APE Coin can be airdropped depends on whether a user holds the instantaneous state of BYAC NFT, and this instantaneous state attacker can manipulate by borrowing a flash loan and then redeeming to obtain BYAC NFT. The attacker first borrows BYAC Token through flash loan, and then redeems to obtain BYAC NFT. Then use these NFTs to claim the airdropped APE, and finally use the BYAC NFT mint to obtain BYAC Token to return the flash loan."

This incident exploited a vulnerability in the platform's API. In a specific case, a user transferred their NFTs to another wallet to avoid high cancellation fees. Normally, this should have removed the NFT listings from Opensea, but due to API inconsistencies, they remained listed on Rarible. Believing the listings were cancelled, the user transferred the NFTs back to the original wallet, inadvertently setting their price to zero. An opportunist quickly bought these NFTs at no cost from the previous listings, causing substantial losses to the original owner."

                "After spending nearly $40 million on a new set of Azuki NFTs, the Azuki community was outraged that they were \"diluting\" a near-replica of the original Azuki collection. To counter what Azuki’s creators called a “blatant scam,?holders who claim to have collectively spent millions of dollars on the Azuki project formed AzukiDAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which is distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then began voting to hire lawyers to sue the creators of Azuki and demand a return of the 20,000 ETH (approximately $38 million) that the Elementals NFTs had spent in total. However, governance tokens were exploited shortly after the DAO was created. Attackers were able to exploit a flaw in the smart contract, and two exploiters stole approximately 35 ETH (approximately $69,000), mainly because the variable signatureClaimed in the contract was not checked properly, resulting in a replay attack. The DAO suspended the contract to prevent further theft."
